# Contributing to `sb`

Thank you for joining the project!

There are many things that you can do to help us improve `sb`, from usage documentation to a whole new set of features.

If you're looking for inspiration, the [features doc](./docs/features.md) mentions a few things 
that haven't been implemented yet, but are on our roadmap.

Before starting to work on a task, please create a Github issue to ensure that nobody will work concurrently 
on the same feature, and we'll be happy to give you pointers on how to implement anything!


## Contribution process

1. Create a new issue to let us know what you'll be working on
1. Create a fork, commit and push to your fork
2. Send a PR from your fork to this repo with the proposed changes
3. We'll review your change, provide feedback and merge it to `sb` if it's satisfactory


## Contribution to documentation

While we always try to write good documentation, some features are not as documented as we'd like them to be. 

If you enjoy a feature, don't hesitate to document it and even show a screencast to demo it!


## Contribution to the code

To contribute to `sb`, you will need [Golang]((https://golang.org/doc/install)) installed on your machine.

As `sb` is heavily dependent on the operating system to manage users, groups and permissions, it is best 
to code on a Linux machine. For our macOS and Windows friends, you can easily use the [demo](./docs/demo.md) 
Docker container to test your set of features over SSH in a Linux environment.
