# Usage

Every access to your infrastructure should always be done via `sb` so that the session is logged and recorded.
The goal is not to spy on actual users, btw there are currently no admin command to easily grab the session recordings, 
but it gives a fighting chance to know what potential non-authorized people might have done if they ever enter in your 
infra!

Once you're connected to a machine in the infrastructure, feel free to jump to another host if you want. 
The session is still secured and recorded since your first connection was made via `sb`.

And if you're not sure what you did last time? That's OK! Just play your previous recording :)

## Basic usage

```console
t1000@skynet:~# alias sb
sb='ssh t1000@sb.domain.tld -A -t -- '
```

Get information about the `sb instance` and your account:

```console
t1000@skynet:~# sb info
Hi, t1000!

Here are a few information about the wonderful place you just connected to:
  -> my name is sb
  -> I'm located in Europe, my address is sb.domain.tld
  -> here is the list of my IP addresses: 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1
  -> I currently have 256 guests accounts
  -> I'm currently hosting 42 groups

If you want to interact with me, just one of these aliases:
  -> SSH:  alias sb='ssh t1000@sb.domain.tld -t -A --'
  -> MOSH: alias msb='mosh t1000@sb.domain.tld -A --'

But let's talk a bit about yourself, t1000!
  -> you're a member of 7 groups
  -> as you're a member of the owners group, you have extra admin privileges
  -> TOTP is enabled on your account
  -> you only have 2 unused emergency codes left. You should generate new ones right away!
```

## Use SCP across sb

If your goal is to transfer files from or to a distant host with `scp` through `sb`, you're in luck!

First, you'll need to setup your local machine by downloading an `scp program` from `sb`:
```console
t1000@skynet:~# sb scp --get-script > ~/.sbscp && chmod +x ~/.sbscp
```

This command downloaded a program that was saved in the `.sbscp` file in your home directory, and was made executable.

Then, you'll need to set up yet another alias:
```console
t1000@skynet:~# alias sbscp='scp -S ~/.sbscp '
```

And that's pretty much it, just use `sbscp` as you would use `scp`!
```console
t1000@skynet:~# sbscp README.md root@10.0.0.10:/tmp/README.md
Authenticated to 10.0.0.1 ([10.0.0.1]:22).
README.md                     100% 3207   126.3KB/s   00:00    
Transferred: sent 5396, received 2812 bytes, in 1.0 seconds
Bytes per second: sent 5417.9, received 2823.4
```

## Enable and use Time-based One-Time Password

If you want an extra security on top of the SSH key pair authentication when connecting to `sb`, 
you can enable TOTP on your account. 

The following command will trigger the TOTP setup on `sb`:
```console
t1000@skynet:~# sb self totp enable
```

It will display an `otpauth URL`, a `secret key` and a `QR-Code` that you will need to configure 
in an application like `Google Authenticator`, `Authy` or any other TOTP application.

Once this is done, you just need to validate that you configured your TOTP application correctly 
by entering a validation code generated by the application. If the code is correct, you're all set!

`sb` will provide you with 5 emergency codes that you need to keep securely in case you lose access 
to your TOTP application. These codes will never been shown again, and each of these can replace a TOTP only once.

You can generate new codes with the following command:
```console
t1000@skynet:~# sb self totp emergency-codes generate
```

You can also disable TOTP on your account with the following command:
```console
t1000@skynet:~# sb self totp disable
```
